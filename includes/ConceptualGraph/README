This is the base class for Sowa’s Conceptual Graphs. 
It utilises a form of directed bipartite diagram, where nodes are categorised either as “Relations” or as “Concepts”.

The graph has: Concepts, Relations and Edges between those types of vertices.

Isomorphism is examined by checking if two graphs have the exact same relations and concepts and the exact same edges.
