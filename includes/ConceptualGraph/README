This is the base class for Sowa’s Conceptual Graphs.
It utilises a form of directed bipartite diagram,
where nodes are categorised either as “Relations” or
as “Concepts”.

A Relation may have an edge towards a Concept, 
but not vice versa. The order (Index) of an edge
is also significant, as a different one, may
signify a different graph.

Finally, Isomorphism is examined by checking if
two graphs have the exact same relations and concepts
and the exact same edges.
