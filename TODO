TODO [branch development]:

    1 - Remove rapidjson and use boost
	    - Serialise using Boost (instead of manual JSON creation)

    2 - Implement Utilities: 
                - Intersections, 
                - Differences,
                - Cluster of Nodes: find for current node, what other nodes it has common edges with.
                - Fully connected: are two groups (vectors, arrays, lists) of Nodes (R,C || C,R) fully connected by edges?

    3 - Implement Conversion of a Conceptual Graph to CGIF (string), or FOL.
                - Consider other FOL,HOL or Ontology Schemas (RDF?OWL?) to which we can translate Conceptual Graphs

    4 - Consider optimising the library (Token/Node/Relation/Concept/Edge already are more or less)
        Look into ConceptualGraph and see if anything can be made better/faster
