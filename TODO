This is the project that should form an OpenSource project called CG++

Make this a Header ONLY project, a very minimalistic and simple to use library,
which will support: 

	JSON (de)serialisation which is custom and manual
	Binary (de)serialisation which supported by Cereal++11
	

TODO:

    (1.a) TEST ConceptualGraph Copy Constructor

    (1.b) TEST if boost throws exception when it canâ€™t cast properly.

    (2) ConceptualGraph: Construct from JSON, Output to JSON
    
    (3) Save Graph as a single file - Save Many Graphs (e.g. vector) as a single file

    (4) Publish on GitHub / Licencing (BSD 3) - Ask Alexandra first

    (5) Include/Redistribute cereal & rapidjson with cg++
