This is the project that should form an OpenSource project called CG++

Make this a Header ONLY project, a very minimalistic and simple to use library,
which will support:

	JSON (de)serialisation which is custom and manual
	Binary (de)serialisation which supported by Cereal++11

TODO:

    (1) Rename "/includes/cgpp" to "/includes/core"
    (2) Include/Redistribute cereal & rapidjson with cg++
