TODO [branch development]:

    0 - ASAP: fix Jaccard Coefficient Weights, by using the Ratio of each Set (Concepts,Relations,Edges)
            : fix Sorensen Coefficeint Weights, instead of using 50%-50%

    1 - Remove rapidjson and use boost
	    - Serialise using Boost (instead of manual JSON creation)

    2 - Implement Utilities: 
                - Intersections, 
                - Differences,
                - Cluster of Nodes: find for current node, what other nodes it has common edges with.
                - Fully connected: are two groups (vectors, arrays, lists) of Nodes (R,C || C,R) fully connected by edges?

    3 - Implement Conversion of a Conceptual Graph to CGIF (string), or FOL.
                - Consider other FOL,HOL or Ontology Schemas (RDF?OWL?) to which we can translate Conceptual Graphs
