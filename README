This is a minimalistic library implementing John Sowa’s Conceptual Graphs [1].
It uses a much more lax JSON protocol to the one implemented in XML (CGXML, Cogitant, CGIF)
and at the moment, does not conform to the ISO Common Logic Project.
However, it is a very simple library, taking a graph-centric approach,
and should be very easy to use for simple Knowledge Representation.
