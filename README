This is a minimalistic library implementing John Sowa’s Conceptual Graphs [1].
It uses a much more lax JSON protocol to the one implemented in XML (CGXML, Cogitant, CGIF)
and at the moment, does not conform to the ISO Common Logic Project.

However, it is a very simple library, taking a graph-centric approach,
and should be very easy to use for simple Knowledge Representation.

Examples, demonstrate how visualisation and manipulation of Conceptual Graphs can be performed on a web browser, by using VivaGraph JS [https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS].
